   - Choose the LTS (Long Term Support) version for stability

2. **npm** (Node Package Manager)
   - Included with Node.js installation
   - Used to install and manage project dependencies

You can verify your installations by running:

```bash
node -v    # Should show v18.x.x or higher
npm -v     # Should show 8.x.x or higher
```

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cpond8/weathertunes.git
   cd weathertunes
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This command will:

   - Read the `package.json` file
   - Install all required dependencies
   - Create a `node_modules` directory
   - Generate a `package-lock.json` file for version control

3. **Set up environment variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your API keys:

   ```bash
   VITE_PUBLIC_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key_here
   ```

   You can obtain a free API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).
