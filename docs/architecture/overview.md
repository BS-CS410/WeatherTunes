# System Overview

WeatherTunes is a modern web application that combines real-time weather data with music streaming to create a personalized, atmospheric listening experience.

## Core Concept

The application automatically:

- Detects your location and fetches current weather conditions
- Displays dynamic video backgrounds that match weather and time of day
- Provides comprehensive weather forecasts and information
- Adapts the interface theme based on time of day
- Prepares for weather-based music selection from Spotify (pending backend)

## Technology Stack

### Frontend Framework

- **React 19.1.0** - Latest React with concurrent features
- **TypeScript 5.8.3** - Static typing for code quality
- **React Router DOM 7.6.2** - Client-side routing

### Build Tools

- **Vite 6.3.5** - Fast development server and optimized builds
- **Node.js 18+** - JavaScript runtime environment
- **npm** - Package management

### Styling and UI

- **Tailwind CSS 4.1.8** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Radix UI** - Accessible component primitives
- **Lucide React** - Modern icon library
- **Class Variance Authority** - Component variant management

### Code Quality

- **ESLint 9.25.0** - Code linting with TypeScript support
- **Prettier 3.5.3** - Code formatting with Tailwind class sorting

## Architecture Principles

### Design Philosophy

- **Utility-First Styling** - Tailwind CSS for rapid development
- **Type-First Development** - TypeScript strict mode for reliability
- **Component Composition** - Small, focused, reusable components
- **Hook Abstraction** - Custom hooks for complex logic isolation
- **Responsive Mobile-First** - Mobile experience as primary target
- **Accessibility Native** - Radix UI ensures keyboard/screen reader support

### State Management Pattern

- **Global State**: React Context for user settings
- **Local State**: useState/useEffect in custom hooks for feature-specific data
- **Persistence**: localStorage integration for user preferences
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try/catch with graceful fallbacks

## Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Production Ready Features

**Complete Weather System**

- Real-time weather data with OpenWeatherMap API
- 5-day weather forecast with interactive cards
- Sunrise/sunset times with custom icons
- Comprehensive weather metrics (humidity, pressure, wind, visibility)
- Automatic time-based logic for day periods

**Advanced Settings System**

- Temperature units (Fahrenheit/Celsius)
- Time format (12-hour/24-hour)
- Speed units (mph/km/h/m/s)
- Theme mode (automatic/light/dark)
- Location-based default unit selection
- Persistent settings storage

**Modern UI Experience**

- Dynamic video backgrounds (24 weather/time combinations)
- Responsive design for all device sizes
- Automatic theme switching based on time of day
- Glassmorphism design with backdrop blur effects
- Interactive hover effects throughout
- WCAG 2.1 accessibility compliance

### üîÑ UI Ready (Backend Pending)

**Music Integration Components**

- `CurrentlyPlaying.tsx` - Track display with placeholder data
- `UpNext.tsx` - Music queue interface with mock songs
- `NavBar.tsx` - Navigation with Spotify login placeholder
- Complete UI structure ready for real Spotify data

**User Features**

- Authentication flow components
- Favorites system interface
- User preference management

### ‚ùå Requires Backend Development

**Spotify Integration**

- OAuth 2.0 authentication flow
- Real-time music player controls
- Weather-based music selection algorithms
- User library and playlist access

**Data Services**

- User settings synchronization across devices
- Favorites storage and retrieval
- Listening history and analytics
- Cross-session data persistence

## Performance Characteristics

### Optimization Features

- Vite build optimizations with tree-shaking
- Component lazy loading where appropriate
- Asset optimization for video backgrounds
- Weather data caching to reduce API calls

### Bundle Analysis

- Modern browser support (ES2020+)
- Progressive enhancement for older browsers
- Mobile responsiveness across device sizes
- Optimized for fast initial page loads

## Browser Compatibility

### Supported Browsers

- Chrome/Edge 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

### Required Features

- ES2020 support
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- WebAPI: Geolocation, localStorage
- Modern JavaScript features (async/await, modules)

## Security Considerations

### Client-Side Security

- Environment variables for API keys
- Input validation and sanitization
- XSS prevention through React's built-in protections
- HTTPS enforcement for external API calls

### Planned Security (Backend)

- OAuth 2.0 implementation for Spotify
- Secure token handling and refresh mechanisms
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- User data encryption at rest

## Scalability Design

### Frontend Scalability

- Modular component architecture supports easy feature additions
- Custom hook patterns isolate complex logic
- TypeScript enables safe refactoring at scale
- Utility-first CSS prevents style conflicts

### Backend Preparation

- API contracts defined and ready for implementation
- Data structures designed for efficient database storage
- Authentication patterns planned for multi-user scale
- Caching strategies identified for performance

## Future Extensibility

The architecture is designed to support:

- Additional weather data providers
- Multiple music streaming services
- Custom themes and branding
- Plugin system for third-party integrations
- Advanced analytics and user insights
- Social features and sharing capabilities
